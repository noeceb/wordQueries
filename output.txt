1   Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this  
2   continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
3   proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a 
4   great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so 
5   conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met here on a 
6   great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of 
7   it as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that  
8   that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we 
9   should do this. But in a larger sense we can not dedicate - we can not 
10  consecrate - we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and  
11  dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power 
12  to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what 
13  we say here, but can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the  
14  living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they 
15  have, thus far, so nobly carried on. It is rather for us to be here 
16  dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored 
17  dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave 
18  the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that  
19  these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation shall have a 
20  new birth of freedom; and that this government of the people, by the 
21  people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

DESCRIPTION OF MY HASH FUNCTION: 

My hash function generates a unique double for each of the words to be omitted by stringing together the integer value for each char in the word.
Using only mathematical operations, the hash function will assign any word on the omitted list to any of the first 27 indexes.
Any other words will generate a value corresponding to the remaining indexes in the hash table.
